# Introduction - CSS

CSS is a language that describes the appearance of markup. 

Web sites and apps that use HTML have evolved a highly 
sophisticated system. 

HTML provides the structure, CSS defines the appearance, and 
JavaScript provides the logic. 

Why is this considered so advanced? The level of abstraction 
used to create a system that supports a very clear and deliberate 
separation of concerns. CSS allows you to describe in the utmost 
detail how your projects appear in isolation of the structure 
and logic. 

When creating web sites, if you are using the system to your 
best advantage, you should be able to change the appearance 
of your web project by editing the CSS. 

## Competencies 

Following the material and completing the assignments students 
will be able to:

- Create objects in a range of shapes
- Solve positioning problems
  - Position Objects anywhere with pixel precision
- Transform objects via rotation, scale, skew, and translate
- Apply basic principals of design

## Web art

Make a some web art. Use only CSS. Make something artistic. Think 
of this like painting or scuplting with CSS. 

You'll need to work with geometric shapes and text. All objects 
are rectangles you can round the corners, rounding all four 
corners of a square makes a circle. 

This is series of daily coding challenges. 

- Challenge - create one CSS drawing each day for 5 days. 
- Stretch Challenge - Create one CSS drawing every day for 7 days. 

### CSS tools

- transform
  - translate
  - rotate
  - scale 
  - skew
- Position
  - Absolute vs Relative
- Border
  - radius 
  - style
- clip-path

### Principals of design

Art and design is something you can work at for your entire life. 
While it you may spend that time and never think of yourself as an 
artist or designer there are principals of design that you can learn
in a few minutes and apply to your work. 

- Positive and Negative Space - Positive and Negative space refers to 
the main elements in a design and the space around them. 
- Balance - Balance is the most dificult feature of design to work 
with. Balance is the idea arranging elements so the positive and 
negative space work together so that one doesn't over power the other. 
You can look at elements on the page as having different visual weight.
Arranging the visual space so things feel right is balance. 
Balance can take different forms. 
  - Symetrical 
  - Asymetrical 
  - Radial 
- Contrast - Contrast is difference between elements that make them 
standout strongly against each other. It applies to color shape, size
and any other features. 
- Emphasis - Ephasis is the idea of making an element more visually 
dominant. 
- Movement - Movement is the idea of arranging elements in a way to 
lead a viewers eye around the page. 
- Repetition - Repetition manifests as visual patterns that repeat. 
- Rhythm - Rhythm is the creation of visual movement. Like Repetition
Rhythm has patterns, unlike repitition Rhythmic patterns evolve and 
change. 
- Unity - Unity is the idea putting things together that people 
expect to find together. 
- Variety - Variety is the idea of including the unexpected in your 
design. 

### CSS Art Challenges

You challenge is to make some art with CSS. What is art? It can be 
anything you like. For this assignment you need only draw images 
with CSS. 

You need to draw a picture everyday of the week for **5 days**. 

Use Codepen.io. Create your work on Codepen. Do not steal anyone 
elses work! You can steal ideas from others! You just can't take
their work whole. 

You should be using these CSS properties: 

- width, height
- position: absolute, relative
- left, top, right, bottom
- transform: rotate, translate, skew
- border, radius, style, color, width

#### Ideas 

If you can't think of things to draw try these: 

- Food 
  - Hamburger
  - Coffee mug
  - Coffee bean
  - Orange (the fruit)
- Icons
  - Marker
  - Heart
- Nature 
  - Leaf
  - Dropplet
  - Tree
  - Flower
- Vehicles
  - Car
  - Truck 
  - Plane 
  - Flying Saucer
- Animals
  - Elephant
  - Cat

- Architecture
  - House 
  - Office Building
- Labtop
- Lamp
- Hat
- Video Game Controller 
- Fire extinguisher
- Person
- Slack Logo
- Robot
- Make a logo for one of your projects
- Try to recreate a logo: 
  - Target
  - Beats
  - Pinterest

  - Android
  - Instagram
  - Disney (Mickey mouse)
  - Windows
  - Ethereum
  
### Advanced use Gradient

- Use CSS gradient fills.
- Make a pattern with CSS Gradients. 
  - Fork this Repo and submit a pull request to include your pattern!

### Abstract your classes

You'll notice that many of the rules you are writing use the 
same properties and values. Abstract your styles into descriptive 
classes. 

Think about how you can use class names to define generic rules
that apply in many cases. For example:

```CSS
.round {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Clip Path 

Use `clip-path`

### Advanced Stretch Challenge SVG

Use SVG images in your work. 

You can find SVG images in the web, or generate them with Sketch. 

You can import SVG with the img tag

Or pasted SVG code directly in your document. In this case you 
can apply class and id names to SVG elements and apply styles. 


## Lesson 

1 intro 
2 Show examples of graphic design that could be created with CSS
3 Pair and share students find examples 
4 Intro tools needed 
5 Selectors Review 
6 CSS Position
  - absolute
  - relative
  - left, top, right, bottom
7 Border
  - border-width
  - border-style 
  - border-color
  - border-radius
8 Transform 
  - scale 
  - rotate
  - skew
  - translate

In class challenge - Working alone or in pairs use CSS to create 
shapes and arrange them in a page. Choose a principal of design to 
apply. 

This can all look like "modern art". The final results don't really 
matter. 

What is important is to create shapes using CSS and undertand that 
you can set their size, postition and other properties, and to 
conciously attempt to apply the design concepts.
